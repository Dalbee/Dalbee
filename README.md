# 👋 Hi there, I'm Dalbert (Dalbee)

**Software Engineer | Data Architect | GxP & Aerospace Enthusiast**

I build high-integrity, distributed systems that bridge the gap between complex data and real-world operations. With a background spanning **Industrial IoT (Biotech)** and **Enterprise Energy Analytics**, I am now focusing my expertise in DevOps and Data Engineering toward the **Aerospace sector (GNSS & CubeSats)**.

### 🧪 Featured Production-Scale Projects

#### 🧬 [Bioprocess Insight Platform (BIP)](https://github.com/Dalbee/bioprocess-insights-platform)
**High-Fidelity Industrial Digital Twin & GxP Dashboard**
* **Architecture:** Engineered a **Decoupled Triad Architecture** (React HMI ↔ Python SCADA Engine ↔ .NET 10 Compliance Service) to bridge historical data with live operational compliance.
* **Innovation:** Integrated a physics-based Digital Twin linking Impeller RPM to Oxygen Transfer and predictive temperature modeling via moving-window linear regression.
* **Compliance & HMI:** Built a dedicated **.NET microservice** for immutable audit trails (**21 CFR Part 11**) and a React-based HMI featuring deterministic, GxP-compliant pulsing alarms.



#### ⚡ [District Energy Intelligence Platform](https://github.com/Dalbee/energy-analytics-fabric-bi)
**Enterprise Data Engineering & Power BI Analytics (Microsoft Fabric)**
* **Business Impact:** Identified **€4.9M in potential cost recovery** (81,744 MWh efficiency risk) through advanced **Power BI (DAX)** and Star-Schema modeling.
* **Scale:** Implemented a full **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze/Silver/Gold) on OneLake using **PySpark** to process and transform millions of rows of operational telemetry.
* **Visualization:** Developed executive-level **Power BI dashboards** utilizing calculation groups and DirectLake mode to track production vs. demand with sub-second interactivity.
* **Governance:** Established a "Single Source of Truth" by computing complex KPIs upstream in Spark, secured via RLS/OLS, and automated through Fabric CI/CD deployment gates.



#### 🤖 [OrangeHRM Test Factory](https://github.com/Dalbee/OrangeHRM)
**DevOps & Quality Engineering**
* **Stability:** Developed a comprehensive automated testing suite designed for high-frequency deployment environments, ensuring system reliability through rigorous validation.
* **Automation:** Focused on building robust frameworks and CI/CD integration to minimize regression risks in production-aligned scenarios.

### ⚡ Fun Fact
When I'm not architecting data pipelines, I’m balancing life by **cycling**, **singing**, or **playing the piano**. In data and in music, the rhythm and the "timing" (pun intended for GNSS) are everything!
