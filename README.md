# 👋 Hi there, I'm Dalbert (Dalbee)

**Software Engineer | Data Architect | GxP & Aerospace Enthusiast**

I build high-integrity, distributed systems that bridge the gap between complex data and real-world operations. With a background spanning **Industrial IoT (Biotech)** and **Enterprise Energy Analytics**, I am now focusing my expertise in DevOps and Data Engineering toward the **Aerospace sector (GNSS & CubeSats)**.

### 🛰️ Core Mission & Interests
* **Aerospace Transition:** Applying CI/CD and high-availability architecture to GNSS and CubeSat ground segments.
* **Reliable Systems:** Expertise in GxP-compliant software and 21 CFR Part 11 data integrity standards.
* **Distributed Architectures:** Specialized in "Triad" microservice patterns (C#/.NET, Python, React).

### ⚡ Fun Fact
When I'm not architecting data pipelines, I’m balancing life by **cycling**, **singing**, or **playing the piano**. In data and in music, the rhythm and the "timing" (pun intended for GNSS) are everything!
